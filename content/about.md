**I’m a software engineer** with a strong foundation in Java, Python, SQL, and full-stack web development, built through CS coursework focused on data structures and algorithms, software engineering, database management, and mathematics. My technical knowledge is reinforced by hands-on project experience applying modern development practices to build scalable, efficient front-end and back-end applications.

**Most recently**, I built [Witter ↗](https://github.com/chrisdotslash/witter), a full-stack Django web platform with RESTful API architecture, secure multi-state user authentication, and responsive Bootstrap UI, achieving a 99/100 Lighthouse performance score. I also developed a high-performance fintech application called [WalletOne ↗](https://github.com/chrisdotslash/walletone) using object-oriented programming, HashMaps, and in-memory data storage to achieve O(1) search complexity.
